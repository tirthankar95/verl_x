This class doesn’t immediately create an instance of cls.
It stores the class and its init arguments, and only when __call__() is invoked, it actually runs:

Imagine you want to create a model on a remote worker node (e.g., on a different GPU or machine). You can't immediately instantiate the class in the main process and pass it over — that would require pickling the entire model.

Instead, you pass a ClassWithInitArgs object, which contains just:
